Put this plugin on your page if you want something positive on your website.  


== Description ==

The plugin shows a new positive quote every day. There are four different color options, red, blue, green and yellow. The developer decide which quotes there are in the plugin. But if you have any suggestions, let me know on http://positivequoteplugin.com/. You can either have the plugin as a widget or insert the shortcode on in a post or on a page. 

If you want to see the plugin, please go to screenshots or visit http://positivequoteplugin.com/download-plugin/.
